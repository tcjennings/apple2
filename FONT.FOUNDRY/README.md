# Font Foundry

*Font Foundry* by Doug Hennig was published in *Nibble* Magazine (November 1986) and collected in *Nibble Express Volume 7* (page 220).

The program consists of three mandatory parts:

1. `CHAR.ED`, an Applesoft program that implements a character set editor.
2. `CHAR.GEN`, an assembly/machine language program that attaches runtime "ampersand" commands to Applesoft.
3. `NORMAL.SET`, the standard character set with additional useful glyphs in an alternate set.

These programs are not reproduced here as they are not necessarily subject to the same license as this repository.

The program is available for free download from the Nibble Magazine website, where a complete collection of Nibble Disks can be downloaded.

Doug Hennig's The Font Foundry can be found on disk 29 in this collection (`NIB29B.DSK`).

# CHARACTER.SETS

## GOLDBOX.SET

A character set for `CHAR.GEN` that clones the screen font used in the SSI "Gold Box" games, e.g., *Pool of Radiance*.
